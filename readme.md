Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click on one of the buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The computer will also make a choice.
The winner of each round will be displayed, along with the updated score.
After 5 rounds, the game will announce the overall winner or a tie.
Code Structure:

index.html: This file contains the basic HTML structure of the game, including the buttons, images, and score displays.
script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that controls the game logic. It includes functions for generating the computer's choice, playing a round, and displaying the results.
styles.css: This file contains the CSS styles that define the appearance of the game elements.
Additional Notes:

The game uses images for the rock, paper, and scissors choices. Make sure to include these images (rock.png, paper.png, scissors.png, computer.png, and user.png) in the img folder.
The code includes a commented-out section for an announcement popup that is meant to displays the winner or tie message after the game. This will be worked upon later on in this project. You can uncomment this section if you want to use it.
I hope this README file provides a clear overview of the Rock Paper Scissors game!
